# Openfoam.com convergence detection

## Motivation

Why we think this is better when runTimeControl in openfoam and residuals

## How it works

This functionObject runs every iteration, it pulls force data and it stores the total force which is later used for the gradient calculation.

## Parameters explanation

### windowNormalization 0.5;

### windowGradient 0.5;

### windowGradientAveraging 0.99;

### windowEvaluation 0.333;

### windowEvaluationAveraging 0.333;

### thresholdConvergence 0.075;

### thresholdAveraging 0.025;

### iterationMaxConvergence 4000;

If simulation does not converge start forced averging at 4000 iterations

### iterationMaxAveraging 2000;

If simulation does not converge within 4000 iterations run 2000 averaging iterations so in total simulation will have 6000 iterations

### iterationMinConvergence 200;

Minimum number of iterations in case simulation converges before 200 iterations

### iterationMinAveraging 200;

Minimum number of averaging iterations in case simulation converges at iterationMinConvergence

### forceStabilityFactor 2;

In case forces explode this factor is used to check if forces are 2 times higher or lower when the converged value and in case of that it stops the simulation. If this happens it means your mesh is not good enough.
